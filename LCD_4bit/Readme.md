# Simple AVR LCD HD44780 library

This library using 4bit (4 pins) transmission to communicate with lcd display. In header file define your connection with lcd.

This library is not using RW pin - just connect it to GND, or change some code. You can define your own characters, check this funtion in c file where you can change if you want to load characters from RAM, or FLASH memory. :P
